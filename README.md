# Phong-and-Gouraud-lighting

The objective of the work is to implement the
Phong lighting, rated:
- at each vertex (Gouraud shading)
- for each fragment (Phong shading).
The graphical interface must use the dat.gui library. The scene is
composed of 1 single object that can be modified
(geometric and material transformations) and even see
changed its geometry, replacing it with another. In the corner
top left will be the interface that allows you to manipulate the
object. In this interface you can also choose to choose
vertex or fragment lighting
The user can configure some viewing options
(back face culling, z-buffer and position/orientation visualization
lights). On the other hand, the application should also allow
the modification of the perspective projection parameters (fovy, near and far), as well as the positioning and orientation of the camera. The implementation must begin
of the work starting from the solution of practical exercise 27, which allows you to manipulate the camera. If
choose not to do so, you are expected to implement identical mechanisms in your solution.
The application must also support the use and configuration of 3 lights, with associated
following features:
- change between punctual or directional
- change its characteristics (intensities)
- change your position and orientation.
The interface for controlling the camera, lights and display options should be in the corner
top right.
